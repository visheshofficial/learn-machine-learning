# Chapter 2. Introduction to Machine Learning Systems Design

### Business and ML Objectives

    - ML Metrics (accuracy, F1 score, inference latency, etc) Vs Business Metrics (maximize profits for shareholders.)

### Requirements for ML Systems

- Reliability
  - continue to perform the correct function at the desired level of performance even in the face of adversity
  - ML systems can fail silently.

- Scalability
  - System grows in size, complexity , features,
  - automatically
  - artifact management

- Maintainability
  - different componenets should be able to work together
  - documnetation

- Adaptability
  - ML systems are part code, part data, and data can change quickly
  -

- Iterative process

- Framing ML problems

### Types of ML Tasks

 -Classification ( classify inputs into different categories) versus regression (output a continuous value)

- A regression model can easily be framed as a classification model and vice versa

- Binary versus multiclass classification

- Multiclass versus multilabel classification

- Multiple ways to frame a problem

- Objective Functions
